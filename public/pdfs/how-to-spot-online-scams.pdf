## 1. Recognize the Red Flags

### 🚩 Urgency or Pressure

Scammers often try to rush you into making a decision. They may say things like:

* "Your account will be locked unless you act now."
* "This offer is only available for 30 minutes."

### 🚩 Suspicious Email Addresses

Legitimate companies use clear, consistent email addresses. Watch out for emails like:

* `support@secure-paypal-verify123.com`
* `microsoft123xzy@gmail.com`

### 🚩 Typos and Grammar Mistakes

Most real businesses have professionally written emails. If the message looks sloppy, it may be fake.

### 🚩 Unusual Payment Requests

Be cautious if you’re asked to:

* Pay with gift cards
* Send money through wire transfers
* Share banking info via email

## 2. Visual Example: Scam vs. Safe Email

### ❌ Fake Email Example

> **Subject:** Your Account is Suspended
> **From:** [security-paypall@alerts.biz](mailto:security-paypall@alerts.biz)
> "Click this link to unlock your account immediately!"

🛑 Red Flags:

* Urgency
* Incorrect sender email
* Generic greeting ("Dear Customer")

### ✅ Real Email Example

> **Subject:** Notification of Activity
> **From:** [service@paypal.com](mailto:service@paypal.com)
> "Hello John, please log into your account to verify recent activity."

✅ Green Flags:

* Correct domain
* Personalized greeting
* Professional layout
